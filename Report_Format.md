The final report will include the following:

1. **Title, Authors, Abstract**  
2. **Introduction**: Introduction to the problem  
3. **Used Models**: Briefly explain the models used and why you chose them  
4. **Approach**: Methodology, technical details, and choices made  
5. **Results**: Qualitative and quantitative analysis  
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of your findings  
7. **References**  

Submissions
The final report (pdf file) need to be submitted to blackboard by  May 9th 23:59 hrs. (A github link to the code should be sent as supplementary material but it will not be graded). Please note that I have activated the multiple attempts option which allows you to submit maximum three times and only the last submission will be graded. The grading will be based on the clarity of the document, the technical content, critical analysis and the performance.

Winners and Bonus:
The top three highest-performing groups will be invited to present their results in class on May 28th. Each winning group will receive a 0.25 bonus added to their final grade.

Further details
For neural network implementation, you may use any suitable library. We suggest  PyTorch or  Tensorflow (note that TF v2 incorporates the keras api). The documentation on the official pages of these frameworks includes several tutorials. Some other useful links, which include pointers to model checkpoints and datasets.
